Rock Paper Scissiors lizard Spock game from Rice University's python course, modified to use python Arcade. Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is from Big Bang Theory. 

Original code from code skulptor: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_Kb9OpRWTCf_1.py 

Status: Complete as it was written originally. I am working on adding an Arcade GUI and making it interactive.
